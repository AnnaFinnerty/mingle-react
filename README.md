# Elevator Pitch
Whether they are friends or strangers, groups can have a hard time deciding on what music to listen to. Song Battle is a cooperative playlist that allows users (moderated by a creator) to collectively vote on a playlist of music -- anonymously. Different user options allow users to replace songs, add more than one song, and remove voting entirely, all with the goal of achieving the impossible: the perfect playlist to satisfy everyone's tastes.

## Technologies Used

## Scope of Work

Build app to allows a group of users (invited by one playlist creator) to collectively create a playlist and (optionally) vote on what songs remain in the list.

Users can optionally remain anonymous until voting has completed.
